### Observations
- MAC addresses were only available for hosts on the same broadcast domain
- One host did not return MAC information, likely due to routing behavior
- Unknown vendors may require further investigation

### Next Steps
- Perform targeted port scans on identified hosts
- Correlate findings with DHCP and switch logs
- Validate assets against inventory records

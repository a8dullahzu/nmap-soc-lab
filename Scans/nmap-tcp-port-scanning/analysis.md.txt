## Analysis

- DNS and HTTP services indicate the host is acting as a network gateway or appliance
- Filtered SSH and Telnet ports suggest firewall rules are blocking remote access
- Telnet not being open reduces risk associated with insecure protocols
- Closed ports minimize the attack surface of the host

## Next Steps
- Perform service/version detection on open ports
- Review firewall rules for management services
- Monitor DNS and HTTP services for anomalous activity
